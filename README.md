**MicroLibrary** - contains various of logical functions and techniques to simplify some decisions in the field of automation and decision in selection systems.

In most cases, developers will need this library for platforms on microcontrollers and for embedded systems.

## The library solves issues related to:
- Automation of temperature processes (heaters, coolers, etc.)
- Automation of the work of internal system timers (device reboot on a specific event, monitoring and overflow protection for a limited counter, etc.)
- Queue management (create, receive, send)
- Registration of events (on start, on shutdown, on restart, etc.)
- Priority system and decision system
- High level of code abstraction without extra bytes
